Hi, I'm Bryce! I work as a Software Engineer at [Capital Group](https://www.capitalgroup.com/) on the Investment Research and Management team where I build portfolio research and analysis tools for our investors.

Previously, I worked at [Naval Information Warfare Center](https://www.niwcpacific.navy.mil/) developing shipboard communication systems and at the [University of California, San Diego](https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/index.html) developing custom IT management software. I also graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science.

Outside of work, I like climbing, playing board games, and managing my homelab. If you're interested in working together or just saying hello, feel free to reach out using any of the contact methods below!
