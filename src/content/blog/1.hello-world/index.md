I've always found those Web 1.0-style personal homepages very charming, so I decided to make one of my own. I wonder what I'll end up doing with it?

This blog (along with the rest of my website) was created with <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro</a> and is hosted on my homelab. Most of the site is generated as static HTML and JavaScript isn't required to view any core content. This site doesn't use cookies or store any of your data. The source code for this site is on GitHub and changes to the site are automatically deployed with Drone CI.
