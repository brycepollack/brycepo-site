This blog (along with the rest of my website) was created with <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro</a> and is hosted on my home server. Most of the site is generated as static HTML and JavaScript isn't required to view any core content. This site doesn't use cookies or store any of your data; any data gathered is done via <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare Analytics</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/brycepollack/brycepo-site" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code</a> for this site is available on GitHub.
